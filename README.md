# CoinBlock
:zap: CoinBlock blocks services like CoinHive from using your browser to mine cryptocurrency without your consent.

### What?
CoinBlock is a browser extention that blocks requests to browser mining services.  It currently works in the chrome browser, with support for other browsers on the way.

### Why?
recently, some sites have turned to cryptocurrency mining for revenue.  While not inheritly evil, I belive that mining without the users consent is wrong.
#### Mining in your browser:
